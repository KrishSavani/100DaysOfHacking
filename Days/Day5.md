# Day-5 Summary:

### Things Done Today:

- [X] **HackTheBox Academy:**
  - [Windows Fundamentals](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-fundamentals): Instead of pretty hectic day, covered half of the module. And damn, gotta give a respect to the creator for such a detailed content. Not sure if I can complete the module by tomorrow as gotta go uni tomorrow for a presentation. 

- [X] **[BSIDES AHMEDABAD 2021](https://bsidesahmedabad.in/2021/) Conference:** Booked my tickets for the same [My First IRL Conference], excited to network with amazing hackers and much more. LFG. If you are attending, do lemme know. :)

### Extra's

- [X] **Darknet Diaries:**
  - [EP 24: Operation Bayonet](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/24/): Got to know how AlphaBay became the most popular dark market after the shut down of "Silk Road 2.0" as well as "Evolution" [as the admins stole the bitcoin lol], not just that, but how the feds caught the Admin [Alexandre Caz√®s - Alpha02]. Do you wanna know where "Hansa" came into picture and why this was called Operation Bayonet, you know what to do. :)
