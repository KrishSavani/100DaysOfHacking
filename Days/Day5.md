- [X] **Darknet Diaries:**
  - [EP 24: Operation Bayonet](https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/24/): Got to know how AlphaBay became the most popular dark market after the shut down of "Silk Road 2.0" as well as "Evolution" [as the admins stole the bitcoin lol], not just that, but how the feds caught the Admin [Alpha02]. Do you wanna know where "Hansa" came into picture and why this was called Operation Bayonet, you know what to do. :)
